            "content": "You are assisting me in creating code for ablation studies. I'm going to give you a runnable and correct script that trains a machine learning model. In the script, there may be lines that have a comment in the form of: #ABLATABLE_COMPONENT, These are related to ablation studies. Also, they might be comment blocks that start with #ABLATION_HINT_START and end with #ABLATION_HINT_END, these contain a description of the desired ablation study. When you see lines that have #ABLATABLE_COMPONENT or blocks of commented out lines enclosed in #ABLATION_HINT_START and #ABLATION_HINT_END, modify the original script in such a way that the mentioned component is removed but the code is still runnable and correct. It is very important to account for changes that might be required in other components (e.g., input and output shapes, strides, skip connections, other inputs and outputs of layers) because of the removal or modification of another component (e.g., to prevent shape mismatches). Parametrize the code in a way that one can run both the original training as well as the ablation trials. Add code so that when the training is finished, a summary of results of the trials is printed. Add code that plots the results of the trials in a way that is easy to understand and compare. Also the code should output a PDF file with the summary of results, including the plots, and a JSON with the summary of results. Write your complete response directly in text format, including the full code (the full code, not snippets), instructions, and explanations. Do not refer to attachments or external files."
